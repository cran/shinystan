The standard error of the mean of the posterior draws (not to be confused with the standard deviation of the posterior draws) is the uncertainty associated with the Monte Carlo approximation. This quantity approaches 0 as the sample size goes to infinity, whereas the standard deviation of the posterior draws approaches the standard deviation of the posterior distribution. See the Glossary page for more details.
