  <em>Quick definition</em>
</span>

The acceptance statistic used by NUTS for slice and Metropolis rejection.   
<code>accept_stat</code> is acceptance probability averaged over samples 
in the slice. For HMC without NUTS <code>accept_stat</code> is the standard 
Metropolis acceptance probability.

If the leapfrog integrator were perfect numerically, there would no need to do 
any more randomization per transition than generating a random momentum vector. 
Instead, what is done in practice to account for numerical errors during 
integration is to apply a Metropolis acceptance step. If the proposal is not 
accepted, the previous parameter value is returned for the next draw and used 
to initialize the next iteration.

<p>
By setting the target acceptance parameter to a value closer to 1 (its value
must be strictly less than 1 and its default value is 0.8), adaptation will be
forced to use smaller step sizes. This can improve sampling efficiency
(effective samples per iteration) at the cost of increased iteration times.
Raising the target will also allow some models that would otherwise get
stuck to overcome their blockages.
